# BAUST-Book-Store

📖 About the Project

Baust-Book Exchange is a web application built for BAUST students to simplify book exchange between different level-term students.

Senior students can list their old books for sale.

Junior students can search and purchase required books based on their level-term.

A note-sharing section is available for each level-term, so students can easily access study notes.

This platform reduces book costs, promotes reuse, and helps students access learning resources.
